PROJECT OVERVIEW

This program ensures cleaner execution by preventing invalid input types. Fields expecting numeric values cannot be filled with text. Instead of crashing, the program prompts the user to try again, maintaining smooth control flow.
PERFORMANCE

    🚫 Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., text where numbers are expected)

    🔁 Graceful error handling: prompts re-entry instead of closing

    ⚡ Enhanced turtle speed for better animation

    🧼 Cleaner code structure and smoother workflow

The turtle's movement speed has been increased for a more dynamic and responsive experience. The overall performance is smoother and more consistent than before.
