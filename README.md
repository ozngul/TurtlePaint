PROJECT OVERVIEW

The program draws three specific shapes in canvas dimensions with a turtle. Triangle, Square and Round. In general, we have detailed the program from the following sides:
PERFORMANCE


    🚫 Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., text where numbers are expected)

    ➕ Checkered areas in the background to better understand the coordinate

    🔴 Origin point so that we can understand where we are at all times

    🔁 Graceful error handling: prompts re-entry instead of closing

    ⚡ Enhanced turtle speed for better animation

    🧼 Cleaner code structure and smoother workflow

    

The turtle's movement speed has been increased for a more dynamic and responsive experience. The overall performance is smoother and more consistent than before.
